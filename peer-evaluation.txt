Peer's repository: https://github.com/brockco1/05-Space-Shooter.git



What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?
I learned that it's important to be careful what file types you use, because I had to struggle to open the .7z file that was included.

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?
All of their variable names were very clear and descriptive, and I would like to focus on trying to do that with my variable names as well.
 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?
The code as a whole was well written and decently commented, I just wish the game itself had more to it.
 

What could have been clearer or better commented?
I know it seems very clear, but it wouldn't hurt to add a comment explaining what's happening when you
initalize the window in lines 64 through 76.
 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?
Within the code there was nothing confusing, but the readme file gave me pause... (See below)
 

The repository contains an appropriate license.
 

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
I'm honestly not sure I was playing the right game based off of the description in the README file.
I ran the main.py file and shot at an asset named "factory" which looks like a skull.
The readme file says that the space ship is shooting at asteroids in this game...
 

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.
The code was very easy to follow and understand, and knowing my habit for making a mangled mess of code,
I greatly admire that.
