    - Seeing the sprite textures in my peer's project makes me consider utilizing that theme in my own projects.
 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?
    - None
 

What could have been clearer or better commented?
    - Some comments described penguin enemies, but the enemies appeared to be large ships.
 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?
    - None
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
    - I believe that it must contain a full name, but my peer put their username.
 

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
    - Well, the asteroids mentioned in the README look very similar to that of an enemy spaceship, so I would suggest changing that to more closely resememble the finished product.
 

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.
    - I really liked the sprite model for the user's ship.
